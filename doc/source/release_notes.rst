Release Notes
===========

Please note that as long as wradlib releases are within the ``0.y.z`` series, the API cannot be considered stable. We will try to avoid sudden API breaks via deprecation warnings. All wradlib releases come without any warranty. Release notes might be incomplete. See `here <https://bitbucket.org/wradlib/wradlib/commits/all>`_ for a complete record of changes. 

You can install the latest wradlib release from PyPI via ``pip install wradlib`` or specific version via ``pip install wradlib==x.y.z``.
