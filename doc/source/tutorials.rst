Tutorials
=========

Just some ideas on a few tutorials

- Georeferencing radar data
- Clutter detection and infilling
- Creating quality fields and composition
- Simple Gauge Adjustment

The tutorials should show, how the individual functions and classes can be 
combined together to produce meaningful workflows.

They should also make the user acquainted with the data structures that are used 
throughout the library, especially that e.g. composition may happen without the 
data being reshaped to gridded form etc.
