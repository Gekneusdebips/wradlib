wradlib: An Open Source Library for Weather Radar Data Processing
=================================================================

The *wradlib* project has been initiated in order facilitate the use of weather radar data as well as to provide a common platform for research on new algorithms. *wradlib* is an open source library which is well documented and easy to use. It is written in the free programming language `Python <http://www.python.org>`_. If you want you can jump to the `table of contents`_.

Weather radar data is potentially useful in meteorology, hydrology and risk management. Its ability to provide information on precipitation 
with high spatio-temporal resolution over large areas makes it an invaluable tool for short term weather forecasting or flash flood forecasting.

*wradlib* is designed to assist you in the most important steps of processing weather radar data. These may include: reading common data formats, georeferencing, converting reflectivity to rainfall intensity, identifying and correcting typical error sources (such as clutter or attenuation) and visualising the data.

This documentation is under steady development. It provides a complete library reference as well as a set of tutorials which will get you started in working with *wradlib*.
