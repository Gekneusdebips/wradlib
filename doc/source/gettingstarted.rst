Getting Started
===============

Installation
------------

Get the source from bitbucket and either copy the wradlib folder into your site-
packages folder or add the path to the wradlib folder to your PYTHONPATH.


Dependencies
------------

wradlib was not designed to be a self-contained library. Besides extensive use 
of Numpy and Scipy, some of the more elaborate tools may depend on additional 
libraries, which you will need to install before you can use this library.

We keep a list of external dependencies for each module here including links, 
where to download the relevant packages.

As satisfying all cross-dependencies might become tedious under MS Windows, we 
recommend using a distribution like python(x,y) or EPD. Chances are that all 
necessary packages are contained in there.
