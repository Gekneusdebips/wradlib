How to contribute to wradlib?
-----------------------------

We need your help to enhance the capabilities of wradlib! Is there an algorithm you would consider useful? Please provide code (in any programming language) or documentation to the `developers`_. We will it a try to integrate this algorithm in wradlib. 

*However, there is an even better way!* **(Step 1)** `Fork <http://bitbucket.org/wradlib/wradlib/fork>`_ your own wradlib repository from the `main wradlib repo <http://bitbucket.org/wradlib/wradlib>`_. **(Step 2)** Implement your changes into the forked repository. Test your code. **(Step 3)** Now you want to feed these changes back into the main wradlib development branch? Start a `Pull Request <http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Fork+a+Repo,+Compare+Code,+and+Create+a+Pull+Request>`_! The `developers`_ will review your changes. On approval, they will merge your fork back into the main wradlib branch. Now everyone can benefit from your improvements. A step-by-step tutorial for a pull request can be found `here <http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Fork+a+Repo,+Compare+Code,+and+Create+a+Pull+Request>`_.
