If you find this file in your wradlib installation directory, it means that your operating system was not able to compile the BUFR software for wradlib.

You sould be able to use wradlib except you will not be able to read BUFR files using wradlib.io.read_BUFR.

If any errors occur during installation or during the import of wradlib to Python, please request support under wradlib-users@googlegroups.com
